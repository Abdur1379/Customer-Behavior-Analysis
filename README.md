🧠 Data Analytics Project — Customer Behavior Analysis
📋 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to uncover patterns and insights from raw data — from loading and cleaning datasets, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running SQL queries, to visualizing insights in a Power BI dashboard.
The final business insights are summarized in a PowerPoint presentation created with Gamma for clear storytelling and presentation.

🔍 Steps Involved
1. Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using Python (pandas.read_csv()).
Verified data types and structure.

2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and outliers.
Standardized column names and data formats.
Removed duplicate or irrelevant records.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics.
Visualized trends in customer spending and purchase frequency.
Analyzed correlations between demographics and purchasing patterns.

4. SQL Analysis
Imported the cleaned dataset into a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server database.

Wrote SQL queries to:
Retrieve key business insights (e.g., top customers, high-selling products).
Perform aggregation and filtering.
Join multiple tables for deeper analysis.

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
Connected Power BI to the SQL database.

Built interactive dashboards showing:
Sales by region, category, and gender.
Top products and customer segments.
Month-over-month performance.

6. Final Report & Presentation
Compiled insights and visuals into a Gamma AI-powered presentation.

Presented business recommendations and conclusions.
